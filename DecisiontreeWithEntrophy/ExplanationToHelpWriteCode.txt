Find Information gain of all attributes(Outlook,wind,humidity,temperature).
For finding information gain of each attribute ,Eg. outlook calculate the entrophy of outlook and its sub types(sunny,overcast,rainy)
Now subtract overall entrophy(outlook) from the weighted sum of its sub types(sunny,overcast,rainy)
Whichever attribute has more gain make it root node and divide dataset according to their sub types to find the sub node under the sub types.
